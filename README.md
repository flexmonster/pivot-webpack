This repository holds the source code for simple [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts project. 

## Prerequisites

To run a simple application you will need Node.js and npm. <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.

## Step 1: Create a new project based on this sample

Download `.zip` archive with the sample or clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flexmonster/pivot-webpack  my-proj
cd my-proj
```

## Step 2: Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Start the project
Open `index.js` and replace `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` with an actual license key. If you donâ€™t have a license key, [get it here](https://www.flexmonster.com/download-page/).

Run in the console:

```bash
npm start
```

After that, the working sample will be available if you open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
