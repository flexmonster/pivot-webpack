## Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts
Flexmonster Pivot is a powerful Javascript tool for interactive web reporting. It allows you to visualize and analyze data from JSON, CSV, SQL, NoSQL, Elasticsearch, and OLAP data sources fast and conveniently. Flexmonster is designed to integrate seamlessly with any client-side framework and can be easily embedded into your application.

This repository holds the source code for simple [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts project. 

## Prerequisites

To run a simple application you will need Node.js and npm. <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.

## Step 1: Create a new project based on this sample

Download `.zip` archive with the sample or clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flexmonster/pivot-webpack  my-proj
cd my-proj
```

## Step 2: Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Start the project
Open `index.js` and replace `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` with an actual license key. If you donâ€™t have a license key, [get it here](https://www.flexmonster.com/download-page/).

Run in the console:

```bash
npm start
```

After that, the working sample will be available if you open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
